Thank you for your interest in the Software Developer internship job opportunity. I’m sending you a technical test to measure your knowledge and skills. Please complete the next test within 72 hours.
Good luck!

Please show us your strengths/skills by building anything you’d like using data from Torre.
The goal is for us to get an idea of your skills/strengths in the areas of web development, software architecture, algorithms, innovation, strategic thinking, autonomy, learning, attention to detail, and communication. If you join our team, you’ll be working on the full stack. As such, we’ll be evaluating your potential in both front and back-end development.

You can access these endpoints:
    - GET https://torre.bio/api/bios/$username (gets bio information of $username)
    - GET https://torre.co/api/suite/opportunities/$id (gets job information of $id)
    - POST https://search.torre.co/opportunities/_search/?[offset=$offset&size=$size&aggregate=$aggregate] and https://search.torre.co/people/_search/?[offset=$offset&size=$size&aggregate=$aggregate] (search for jobs and people in general).

If you need examples of how they work, you can check the page network requests in your browser when retrieving or modifying information.

Create anything you would like as long as it shows your skills in both the back-end and front-end. Aim to have at least some basic processing or data manipulation, i.e., avoid simply retrieving and displaying raw information. Don’t be afraid to show off.
You can invest as much time as you’d like.
